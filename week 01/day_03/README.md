# Day 03 Progress - Micro Challenges

## Date: Day 03

## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Infinite Guardian

**What we did:**  
Created a loop that repeatedly asks the user for a password and continues running until the user types "Stop".

**What we learned:**  
- How to implement **infinite loops** using `while True`.  
- How to **handle exit conditions manually**.  
- Control flow and **loop termination** best practices.

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Accumulator Pattern

**What we did:**  
Asked the user for a number N and calculated the sum of numbers from 1 to N using a **for loop** and a tracker variable.

**What we learned:**  
- How to implement **accumulators** to track sums in loops.  
- Using **for loops** effectively for iterative calculations.  
- Reinforced **basic arithmetic iteration** in Python.

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Efficient Skipper

**What we did:**  
Looped through numbers 1 to 10, printed each number, but skipped printing the number 5 using the `continue` keyword.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **`continue`** to skip an iteration in a loop.  
- Managing **conditional logic** inside loops.  
- Writing **cleaner and more controlled loops**.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The String Walker

**What we did:**  
Created a string `"DATA"` and printed each letter on a new line using a loop.

**What we learned:**  
- How to **iterate over strings** in Python.  
- Handling **character-level operations** in loops.  
- Basic **string manipulation** and printing formatting.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Practiced different **loop constructs** (`while` and `for`).  
- Learned to **control loop flow** with `continue` and manual exit conditions.  
- Strengthened understanding of **iteration over strings and numbers**.  
- Built foundational skills for **practical programming patterns** in Python.
