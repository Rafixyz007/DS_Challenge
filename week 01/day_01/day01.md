## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Identity Swap

**What we did:**  
Swapped the values of two variables in Python in a single line.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **multiple assignment** in Python.
- Understanding variable references and assignments.

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Type Auditor

**What we did:**  
Took user input, checked its type, cast it to a float, and checked the type again.

**What we learned:**  
- How **input()** works in Python.  
- How to **cast data types** safely.  
- Understanding **type checking** with `type()`.

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Precision Banker

**What we did:**  
Formatted a numeric value to **3 decimal places** and displayed it with a dollar sign.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **string formatting** for precise outputs.  
- Representing **monetary values** correctly in Python.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The Modulo Architect

**What we did:**  
Converted a total number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds using integer division and modulo operations.

**What we learned:**  
- How to perform **integer division (`//`)** and **modulo (`%`)**.  
- Breaking down time calculations into hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Practical use of modulo arithmetic for real-world problems.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Strengthened **Python fundamentals** on variables, data types, and arithmetic operations.
