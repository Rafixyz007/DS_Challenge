## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Guard Clause (Short-Circuiting)

**What we did:**  
Created a user variable and wrote a single-line check to verify if the user is not `None` and has "admin" access safely without crashing.

**What we learned:**  
- How **short-circuiting** works in Python with `and`.  
- Safely handling **None values** in conditional checks.  
- Writing **concise and safe conditional statements**.

---

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Floating Point Trap

**What we did:**  
Checked if `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3`.

**What we learned:**  
- Floating point arithmetic in Python can lead to **precision errors**.  
- Direct equality comparisons with floats can be **unreliable**.  
- Importance of using **tolerances** for float comparisons in real-world scenarios.

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Truthness Inspector

**What we did:**  
Created an empty list and wrote a conditional statement to print messages based on whether the list has data or not, **without explicit comparison**.

**What we learned:**  
- Python treats **empty containers as False** and non-empty as True.  
- Learned to use **truthy/falsy values** in conditions.  
- Writing **cleaner and more Pythonic** conditional checks.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The Ternary Packer

**What we did:**  
Assigned a status variable to "Pass" or "Fail" in **one line** based on a score threshold.

**What we learned:**  
- Using **ternary expressions** for concise conditional assignments.  
- Writing **readable one-line conditional statements**.  
- Practical use of ternary operators for **quick decision-making**.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Reinforced **conditional logic and short-circuiting** in Python.  
- Understood **floating-point behavior** and precision issues.  
- Learned **truthy/falsy evaluations** and **ternary expressions**.  
- Built foundation for writing **clean and concise Python code** in future challenges.
