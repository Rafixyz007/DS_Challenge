## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Input Guard

**What we did:**  
Asked the user for their age and handled cases where the input was not a number without crashing the program.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **try/except blocks** for input validation.  
- Catching **ValueError** to handle invalid user input.  
- Making programs more **user-friendly and robust**.

---

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Math Safety Net

**What we did:**  
Attempted to divide a number by zero and caught the specific error that occurs.

**What we learned:**  
- Division by zero raises a **ZeroDivisionError**.  
- Importance of catching **specific exceptions** instead of generic ones.  
- Preventing runtime crashes in mathematical operations.

---

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Cleanup Crew

**What we did:**  
Performed a division operation inside a try/except block and added a `finally` block that always executes.

**What we learned:**  
- The `finally` block runs **regardless of success or failure**.  
- Useful for cleanup tasks like logging or closing resources.  
- Better control over **program execution flow**.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The Custom Signal

**What we did:**  
Validated user input and manually raised an error when a negative number was provided.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **`raise`** to trigger custom exceptions.  
- Enforcing **business rules** through exceptions.  
- Writing clearer and safer validation logic.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Strengthened understanding of **exception handling** in Python.  
- Learned to write **defensive code** that handles errors gracefully.  
- Practiced catching, raising, and managing exceptions properly.  
- Built confidence in creating **stable and fault-tolerant programs**.
