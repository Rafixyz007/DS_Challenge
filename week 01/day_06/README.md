## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Scope Fortress

**What we did:**  
Created a global variable and attempted to modify it inside a function, then printed the value outside the function.

**What we learned:**  
- Variables inside a function have **local scope** by default.  
- Assigning a value inside a function does **not affect global variables** unless explicitly specified.  
- Clear understanding of **scope boundaries** in Python.

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Pure Return

**What we did:**  
Wrote a function that prints a result but does not return anything, then assigned its output to a variable.

**What we learned:**  
- Functions return `None` by default if no return statement is used.  
- Difference between **printing a value** and **returning a value**.  
- Importance of return statements for reusable logic.

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Default Gateway

**What we did:**  
Created a function with a default parameter and called it both with and without providing an argument.

**What we learned:**  
- How **default arguments** work in Python functions.  
- Functions become more **flexible and reusable** with default values.  
- Overriding default parameters when needed.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The Logic Gate

**What we did:**  
Implemented a function that checks if a number is even and returns a boolean value using a single-line expression.

**What we learned:**  
- Writing **compact logical expressions** in Python.  
- Using **boolean logic** without explicit conditionals.  
- Cleaner and more Pythonic function design.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Strengthened understanding of **function scope and behavior**.  
- Learned the importance of **return values vs side effects**.  
- Practiced **default parameters and concise logic expressions**.  
- Built a solid foundation for writing **clean, predictable functions**.
