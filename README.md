Welcome! This repository documents my **120-day (4-month) Machine Learning career acceleration journey**, designed to build strong fundamentals, hands-on skills, and professional habits needed to land a **Machine Learning / AI role**.  

This is a **mentor-guided, time-bound, and publicly documented challenge** to ensure accountability and measurable progress.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build **strong foundations** in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning  
- Develop **hands-on experience** through daily practice and projects  
- Improve **problem-solving and implementation skills**  
- Cultivate **professional habits**: documentation, logging, and consistency  
- Create a **transparent learning trail** for review and feedback  

---

## 📅 Challenge Duration

- **Start Date:** 15 Dec 2025  
- **End Date:** 15 Apr 2026  
- **Total Duration:** 120 Days

## 🔍 How to Navigate

- Each **week** contains 5–7 **daily folders**  
- Each **day folder** documents:
  - What was **planned**  
  - What was **executed**  
  - What was **learned**  
- **Central progress log** (`PROGRESS.md`) summarizes each day in one line  

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in two ways:  

1. **PROGRESS.md** → High-level daily accountability  
2. **week_n/day_n/README.md** → Detailed daily work, reflections, and experiments  

> 💡 *Tip: Update `progress.json` daily; the badge will automatically reflect your progress via GitHub Actions.*

## 🧑‍🏫 Mentor Guidance

This challenge is conducted **under mentor guidance**, with periodic reviews, feedback, and course corrections to ensure meaningful learning and growth.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository represents an **active learning process**, not a polished production library. Content, structure, and approaches evolve as understanding deepens.

---

## ✨ Let's Go!

Every line of code, every note, and every reflection is a step toward mastering **Machine Learning**.  
Follow along, contribute, or get inspired!
