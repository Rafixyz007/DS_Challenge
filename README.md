## About the Challenge

**Join me on a 120-day journey to master Machine Learning and AI!**  

This challenge focuses on **building strong foundations, hands-on skills, and professional habits** to excel in ML/AI roles.  
Guided by a mentor, it is **time-bound and publicly documented** to ensure **accountability, measurable progress, and a clear learning trail**.

---

## Goals

- Strengthen **math, statistics, and ML fundamentals**  
- Gain **practical experience** through daily projects  
- Improve **problem-solving and coding skills**  
- Cultivate **professional habits**: documentation, logging, consistency  
- Maintain a **transparent learning trail** for review

---

## Timeline

- **Start:** 15 Dec 2025  
- **End:** 15 Apr 2026  
- **Duration:** 120 Days  

---

## How to Navigate

- Each **week folder** contains 5–7 **daily folders**  
- Each **day folder** includes:
  - `README.md` → Goals, work done, reflections  
  - `notes.md` → Optional theory/formula notes  
  - `code.py` → Scripts, experiments, or notebooks  
- `PROGRESS.md` → High-level daily log  
- `progress-badge.json` → Auto-updates the progress badge

## Mentor Guidance

- Conducted **under mentor supervision** with periodic reviews  
- Ensures **daily logs and code align with learning objectives**

---

## Disclaimer

- Active **learning journal**, not a production library  
- Folder structure and content may evolve  
- Focus is on **learning, documenting, and habit-building**

---

## Let’s Go!

Every line of code, note, and reflection is a step toward **Machine Learning mastery**.  
- Follow along  
- Contribute if you want  
- Or get inspired by the journey!
